# HANDWRITTEN-RECOGNITION :- This project focuses on building a machine learning-based system to recognize handwritten digits using the popular MNIST dataset. Leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs), the system is trained to accurately identify digits from 0 to 9.
The project uses Python, along with libraries such as TensorFlow, NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib for model building, data preprocessing, and visualization. Key steps include dataset loading, reshaping, normalization, one-hot encoding, and model training. The final model achieves a high accuracy of 98.5%, demonstrating the effectiveness of deep learning techniques in pattern recognition tasks.
The solution has potential applications in digitizing handwritten forms, automating data entry, and enabling better human-computer interaction in domains such as education, finance, and healthcare.
